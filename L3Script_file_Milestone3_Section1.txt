--Q1: Ents_2hops: This view returns the name of every entity and entity (or entities)
--that are related to the 2 hops away. For example, if E1 is related to E2 via R2
--and the E2 is related to E3 via R3 and E2 is related to E4 via R, we want to print
--the following 2 lines:
--E1, E3
--E1, E4
